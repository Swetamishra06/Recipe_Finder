        Now squeeze the bottle and make concentric rings with the batter.Either start from the center and move outside or vice versa.You won’t get perfect shapes as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles. This does require practice and it also depends on what equipment you are using to make them.

First, measure 1 cup of gram flour (besan) and pour it into a mixing bowl.Next, add in your chopped veggies and herbs.
        Here are the ingredients you should include in this step:¼ cup finely chopped onions¼ cup finely chopped tomatoes½ teaspoon finely chopped ginger¼ cup finely chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)½ teaspoon finely chopped green chilies or serrano peppers
                Then it is time to mix in the spices, including 2 to 3 pinches of turmeric powder, ½ teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain) and ¼ teaspoon red chili powder. Also add salt as per your liking at this step.Before you start to stir or combine your ingredients, first add half a cup of water to the besan cheela mixture.
        Next use a wired whisk to combine all of the besan chilla ingredients. Then, add an additional 1 to 3 tablespoons of water, depending on the quality and texture of the besan.
        Continue whisking until the batter has a smooth, flowing consistency. There should not be any lumps, so make sure to break those up while mixing the batter.
        ladle scooping besan chilla batter out of mixing bowlFinally, you can begin cooking your besan chilla! I use a tawa (flat, round-shaped pan) to cook my besan cheela, but you can also use any well seasoned frying pan or a cast iron skillet or a non-stick pan.Next, gently use the back of the ladle or measuring cup (if you have used one) to spread the batter. Make sure you are spreading the batter gently so that the chilla does not break.
        Then continue to cook the chilla on a low to medium-low heat until the top begins to look cooked or you start seeing some air-pockets.Additionally, you can drizzle oil (about ½ to 1 teaspoon) on the chilla at the edges and all around while it is cooking to help it not stick to the pan.In fact for a crispy chilla, you need to add more oil on the pan or skillet before pouring the batter.Next continue to cook until the base gets light golden.Then it’s time to flip your besan cheela and cook the other side.Then continue cooking until you see golden spots on the besan chilla. Cook your besan chilla evenly and well.

In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups (240 grams) of whole wheat flour (atta), ¼ teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of ghee or oil.
        Gradually add water, starting with ¾ cup. Adjust the amount of water depending on the quality of the flour, aiming for a total of ¾ to 1 cup.
        Knead the mixture into a smooth and soft dough. Cover the dough and set it aside to rest.
        To make the stuffing:In a mortar and pestle, take ½ teaspoon of cumin seeds (jeera) and ½ teaspoon of fennel seeds (saunf). Lightly crush them and set aside.
        Take 1 cup of roasted gram flour or roasted black chickpea flour (sattu) in a mixing bowl or pan.
        Add the crushed cumin seeds and fennel seeds to the sattu.
        Now, add ½ teaspoon of carom seeds (ajwain), ½ teaspoon of nigella seeds (kalonji), and ½ teaspoon of red chili powder to the sattu.
        Next, add 1 to 2 teaspoons of chopped green chilies, 1 teaspoon of finely chopped ginger, and 1 teaspoon of finely chopped garlic.
        Mix in 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves, ¼ teaspoon of black salt, and regular salt to taste.
        Add 2 teaspoons of lemon juice followed by 2 teaspoons of mustard oil.
        Mix all the ingredients thoroughly.
        Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of water evenly over the mixture and mix well. Add more water if needed, ensuring the mixture is neither too dry nor too wet.The stuffing should have a moist consistency for the best taste and texture.To assemble, shape, and make Litti:

        After resting the dough for 30 minutes, divide it into small or medium-sized balls.For the first method, dust a little flour and roll each dough ball into a circle about 5 to 6 inches in diameter.Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the stuffing mixture in the center of each rolled disc.Pleat and seal the edges of the disc to enclose the stuffing.Press the sealed part and gently roll the stuffed dough ball between your palms to form a round shape. Set aside.
        Alternatively, flatten a dough ball with your palms to create a shallow cup.Fill the cup with the stuffing mixture.Carefully bring together the edges of the dough to encase the stuffing, pressing gently to seal the edges securely.This step may be a bit tricky, so use whichever method is more comfortable for you. Both methods have been provided for stuffing.Here are the prepared Littis using the second method. Keep them covered with a cotton towel or napkin to prevent the dough from drying outTo bake the LittiGrease a baking tray with oil and place the prepared Littis on it.Preheat the oven to 200°C/390°F for 20 minutes before baking.
        After 10 to 15 minutes, remove the tray from the oven and flip each Litti. Return the tray to the oven.Repeat the flipping process every 10 to 15 minutes to ensure even baking.Bake for a total of about 30 to 35 minutes, or until the Littis develop light brown or golden brown spots on the crust.
        Optionally, brush melted ghee over the baked Littis.
        For charred spots, hold each Litti with tongs and briefly expose it to direct flame until charred.Serve the Bihari-style Litti with your choice of chokha, accompanied by a small bowl of melted ghee for dipping. Optionally, sprinkle ghee over the Littis before serving.

        rinse flattened rice once or twice and then add to the rice.
        poha and rice in a bowlPour 2 cups water. Stir and soak both rice and flattened rice together for 4 to 5 hours.
        water added to bowl with rice and poha
         Before grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils+fenugreek seeds and keep it for grinding urad dal.
         Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to the lentils or ½ cup of fresh water if you like.
        lentils added to grinder jarGrind the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the dosa batter ferments well.
        grinded lentils
         Remove batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula. Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar
        You can even add ¾ cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice. So you may need to add less or more water.
        rice in the grinder jar
         Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava (cream of wheat) like consistency of the ground rice grains
        grinded riceNow pour the rice+flattened rice batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad lentil batter.
        grinded rice added to bowl containing grinded lentils
        Add ½ teaspoon edible rock salt or add as per taste.
        salt added to bowl Mix the salt very well with the ground batter. Also, mix both the rice batter and the urad lentil batter thoroughly. Cover with a lid and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours at room temperature.
        You can keep for less or more time and this will depend on the temperature conditions in your city. It can take anywhere from 6 hours to a day or more for it to ferment.
        In the Indian summers, the batter ferments quickly and during winters it takes a longer duration of time.
        mix the batter
        You can also use the yogurt setting of your Instant Pot to ferment. Use the “low” option when using the yogurt setting as the “medium” option will cook the batter instead of fermenting it. Cover with a separate lid and not the Instant pot lid as it can get locked.
            For fermenting batter in the instant pot, time will vary from 8 to 12 hours
        A well fermented batter will double or triple in volume, have a pleasant sour aroma with many tiny air-pockets.
        Once your batter is nicely fermented, cover and refrigerate it when you start to make the potato masala stuffing. In hotter seasons, the batter kept at room temperature will continue to ferment and will become very sour.
        fermented batter after some hours
         Make Potato Filling
         First rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker.
        You can also boil potatoes in a pan or in an Instant pot. The potatoes have to be completely cooked and fork tender.

        Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. You will also see tiny air pockets in the batter with an increase in its volume.
        take batter in a big spoon
        Heat a cast iron pan or a flat non-stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. Smear some oil if using an iron pan or griddle. Don’t smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won’t be able to spread the batter easily
        Dosa batter has a medium-thick to medium flowing consistency and is easily pourable.
        Keep the heat to a low, while spreading batter.
        Spread the batter in a circular way on the pan. On a medium heat, cook the dosa,Sprinkle some oil on top and edges
        Cover the dosa with a lid and let it cook.
        Cook till its base becomes golden and crisp. You can spread the oil which was sprinkled earlier on the dosa with a spoon.
         When you see the base has become golden, the edges have separated from the pan and the dosa has cooked, place a portion of the potato masala filling on the dosa.

 Rinse 3 medium sized potatoes (250 grams) in fresh water and then peel them. Chop the potatoes in small bite sized cubes.
    Mix with the oil and begin to fry them. Remember to fry at medium heat.
Warm or a cooler temperature of the oil will make the potatoes soggy with oil. A very hot oil will brown the outer crust of the potato cubes quickly but they will be undercooked from the center.
chopped potatoes frying and a slotted spoon
when one side becomes golden, turn the potatoes over and fry them on the other side. Keep on turning the potatoes at intervals using a slotted spoon until they are fried evenly.
 Fry until the potatoes are crispy and golden. Make sure the potato cubes are not raw or half-cooked on the inside.
 Once the potatoes are tender, crisp and golden then remove them with a slotted spoon draining as much oil in the pan as possible.

          Proof the yeast:
Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
After 5 minutes stir if the yeast has not dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.
How to Proof Yeast
Make and knead the pizza dough:
Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.
Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.
If you do not have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.
The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it is too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
Let the dough rise:
Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.
At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap.
For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.
For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).
The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.
Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet):
Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you do not have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.
Divide the dough into 2 balls:
Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.
Form 2 round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).
Prep the toppings:
Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way
About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.
Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round:
Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.
Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.
Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches.
Treat the dough gently!
You can also hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers, letting the dough hang and stretch, while working around the edges of the dough.
If a hole appears in your dough, place the dough on a floured surface and push the dough back together to seal the hole.
Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker. Pinch the edges if you want to form a lip
Brush the dough top with olive oil:
Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Let rest another 10 to 15 minutes.
Repeat with the second ball of dough.
Sprinkle the pizza peel with cornmeal, put flattened dough on top:
Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal. (The corn meal will act as little ball bearings to help move the pizza from the pizza peel into the oven.)
Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.
If the dough has lost its shape in the transfer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.
Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings:
Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.
Slide pizza into the oven:
Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal.
Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the baking stone in the oven.
Bake:
Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.
        Now it is ready to serve it
